            ABOUT ME
        </h3>
        <p>
            My name is Savitha I'm a Front End Engineer. 
            I describe myself as a developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform.

              Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects.
              That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. 

              In my free time you can find me at the garden or on tech meetups 
              and conferences .
