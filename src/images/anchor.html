            followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter,
             sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text.

            English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. 
            This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787.

            the inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.
